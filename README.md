# Customizable-AI-Chatbot-For-Customers
To help create a customizable AI chatbot that can interact with customers using various large language models (LLMs), we can follow these steps:

    Set Up a Basic Chatbot Framework: We will design a chatbot that can integrate with multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT-3/4, or other models like BERT, T5) depending on the configuration.

    Backend with a Customizable API: Allow users to select the LLM model they want to use by providing a configuration interface. This will include API calls to interact with different models based on customer preferences.

    User Interface (UI): Build a simple UI or integrate the chatbot into existing systems like websites or messaging platforms.

    Message Handling and Customization: The chatbot should allow configuration for different business cases, user flows, and personalization based on customer needs.

We'll implement the core functionality using Python, focusing on an API-based backend that integrates with a language model, and a simple UI for testing. The bot will use OpenAI's GPT-3/4 API for simplicity, but this can easily be swapped with other models.
Step-by-Step Breakdown

    Install Required Libraries:
        We'll use Flask for the backend API to handle requests from the frontend.
        For interacting with OpenAI’s GPT-3/4, we will use the OpenAI API.

pip install openai flask

    API Configuration:
        You will need an OpenAI API key to interact with GPT models.

    Create the AI Chatbot with Flask and OpenAI API:

import openai
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set your OpenAI API key (you can also use environment variables to store this key)
openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"

# A simple configuration to select models
MODEL_OPTIONS = {
    "gpt-3.5": "text-davinci-003",  # GPT-3
    "gpt-4": "gpt-4",              # GPT-4 (if available)
    "custom_model": "YOUR_CUSTOM_MODEL_ID"
}

# Function to interact with OpenAI's API
def generate_response(model, user_input):
    try:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            model=model,
            prompt=user_input,
            max_tokens=150,
            n=1,
            stop=None,
            temperature=0.7
        )
        message = response.choices[0].text.strip()
        return message
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"

# Route to handle the chatbot interactions
@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    data = request.json
    user_input = data.get("user_input")
    model_choice = data.get("model", "gpt-3.5")  # Default to GPT-3.5

    # Ensure the model is valid
    model = MODEL_OPTIONS.get(model_choice, "gpt-3.5")

    if not user_input:
        return jsonify({"error": "User input is required"}), 400
    
    # Get the AI model response
    response_message = generate_response(model, user_input)

    return jsonify({"response": response_message})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Key Features in this Code:

    Flask Backend: We set up a simple Flask application with a single endpoint /chat that accepts POST requests. The endpoint will receive a user_input and an optional model parameter (default is GPT-3.5).

    Model Selection: The MODEL_OPTIONS dictionary maps model names (like "gpt-3.5" or "gpt-4") to their respective OpenAI models. You can easily add other models here, such as custom models or different versions of GPT.

    Generate Response Function: This function interacts with OpenAI’s API and retrieves a completion based on the user’s input. The max_tokens, temperature, and other parameters can be adjusted based on how the chatbot should behave (e.g., more creative vs. more factual).

    Error Handling: The generate_response function catches errors from the OpenAI API and returns an error message if anything goes wrong.

    JSON API: The Flask route /chat accepts JSON data, making it easy to connect to any frontend application, such as a website chatbot, mobile app, or even integrate with messaging platforms like Slack or Facebook Messenger.

Example Request to the Chatbot API:

You can send a POST request to the /chat endpoint like this:

{
    "user_input": "What is the weather like today?",
    "model": "gpt-3.5"
}

The response might look like:

{
    "response": "The weather today is expected to be sunny with mild temperatures, perfect for a walk outside!"
}

4. Creating a Simple Frontend for the Chatbot (HTML + JavaScript)

To test the chatbot locally, you can create a basic HTML page to send requests to the Flask API:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>AI Chatbot</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>AI Chatbot</h1>
    <div>
        <textarea id="user_input" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="Type your question here..."></textarea><br>
        <button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Response:</h3>
        <p id="response"></p>
    </div>

    <script>
        async function sendMessage() {
            const userInput = document.getElementById('user_input').value;
            const responseElement = document.getElementById('response');

            const data = {
                user_input: userInput,
                model: 'gpt-3.5'  // or change to 'gpt-4'
            };

            try {
                const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/chat', {
                    method: 'POST',
                    headers: {
                        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
                    },
                    body: JSON.stringify(data)
                });
                const jsonResponse = await response.json();
                responseElement.textContent = jsonResponse.response;
            } catch (error) {
                responseElement.textContent = 'Error: ' + error.message;
            }
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>

5. Testing Locally

    Start the Flask app by running the Python script:

python app.py

    Open the HTML file in your browser.

    Type a question, hit Send, and see how the chatbot responds using the selected LLM model.

6. Deployment and Scaling

Once you have the basic chatbot working, you can deploy it on a cloud platform such as Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud to make it accessible over the internet.

    For deployment, make sure to use environment variables for sensitive data like the OpenAI API key.
    For scaling, you can use Docker containers or serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda) to handle varying loads.

Conclusion

This code provides the backend API for a customizable AI chatbot with model selection, making it flexible to accommodate different customer needs. The chatbot can be easily expanded with more features like:

    Advanced natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities.
    Contextual conversation handling (maintaining state).
    Integration with external APIs for additional functionality (e.g., CRM systems, product catalogs).

The system is designed to be scalable, user-friendly, and capable of integrating multiple LLMs for different applications.
